# etch-a-sketch

A Browser Based Etch-a-Sketch game to practice DOM Manipulation.

Apart of [The Odin Project][https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch] Curriculum

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Intial completion: base project completed. In need of major reworking. Missing extra features and some solutions feel cobbled together and non- cohesive. Will revisit at a later date

1st update: Refactored intial color changing function to be more readable and do less things. The event listener that handles color change needs to be re worked to use capturing/bubbling as opposed to putting an event listener on every div. Change color button is just there for looks and has no function.

potential features:

1. be able to save your work to a file
2. Save your work to carry over into the next session
3. individual color changing
